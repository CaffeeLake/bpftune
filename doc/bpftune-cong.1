.Nd The congestion algorithm tuner sets congestion control algorithm on TCP sockets.  Linux uses cubic by default, and it works well in a wide range of settings, however it can under-perform in lossy networks.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
If we observe retransmits to a remote host, we anticipate that more drops
to that host may occur; these can lead the default congestion algorithm
(cubic) to assume such drops imply congestion, and we end up with a
pessimistic congestion algorithm that greatly underperforms with respect
to potential bandwitdh.
.Pp
With the above in mind, we count retransmission events by remote host,
and if we see > 100 in the last hour, we utilize BBR as the congestion
algorithm instead, anticipating these sorts of losses may result in
us under-estimating bandwitdh potential.
.Pp
Note that BBR retransmits more than other algorithms, so if we switch
to it we will likely see more retransmits, and potentially stay with
it for a length of time until such losses shake out.
.Pp
We use the tracepoint tcp_retransmit_skb to count retransmits by
remote host, and a TCP-BPF sockops program to set congestion control
algorithm on connect/accept.
